        <h2>What&rsquo;s an ARTI?</h2>
        <p>ARTI stands for Art Rendered Through Identity. It was an idea conceived by 7 talented New Media Design and Interactive Development students at the Rochester Institute of Technology in the fall of 2011. Our team was assigned by our department chairs and we were given 20 short weeks to brainstorm, conceive, and bring and idea to life with our new friends.</p>
        <p>Challenge Accepted.</p>
        <h2>Why did we create ARTI?</h2>
        <p>After extensively brainstorming all of the worlds problems, our team decided that art can lack a personal connection for individuals who merely possess it. Our solution aims to produce a personal, expressive and visually appealing representation of who you are based on your body&rsquo;s biometric data. Perhaps the most innovative feature is that you don&rsquo;t need to be an artist to create stunning artwork. You can simply stand in front of an Xbox Kinect and let A.R.T.I. interpret your body&rsquo;s movements over time.</p>
        <h2>How did we bring the idea to life?</h2>
        <p>After we had our idea thought out, we began to formulate our plan of attack. Using a variety of design and development software as well as the Xbox Kinect, we broke the project down into managable chunks and divided it among our talented team members. The designers took on the challenge of defining the brand, designing a website interface, producing a promotional video as well as a behind the scenes video, posters, and business cards. The developers took on the daunting tasks of learning new programming languages such as Node.js and Redis to implement all of the designers crazy ideas. We spent hundreds of combined hours putting all the pieces together so that you have the opportunity to quickly and easily create professional artwork.</p>
